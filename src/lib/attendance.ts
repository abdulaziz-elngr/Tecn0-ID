/**
 * Attendance business rules (spec §9–§13).
 *
 * The decision logic is a PURE function so it can be unit-tested
 * exhaustively without a database. `src/app/api/attendance/scan/route.ts`
 * loads the facts from Postgres, hands them to `evaluateAttendance()`,
 * and only writes a row when the decision is `allowed`.
 *
 * Rules enforced here:
 *   Rule 1  A student cannot have duplicate attendance for one session.
 *   Rule 2  A student scanning at a group that is not their own group
 *           always requires an explicit human decision (Accept make-up
 *           / Reject) — evaluateAttendance() never auto-approves this,
 *           it returns `needsConfirmation: true` until the caller
 *           passes `confirmMakeUp: true` (i.e. the admin clicked
 *           "Accept make-up attendance" in the UI).
 *   Rule 3  Group capacity cannot be exceeded (unless overridden).
